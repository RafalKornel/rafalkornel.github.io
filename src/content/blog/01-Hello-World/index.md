## Hello!

My name is Rafał Kornel, and I am a software developer.
This is my personal website. I will post my thoughts on technology, interesting findings, and sometimes
learning resources. 

I'm currently working as a backend developer in Node.js, and I'm studying computer science.

I'm interested in all kinds of topics, starting from web development, through game dev, AI and to security.
