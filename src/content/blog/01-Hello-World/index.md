## Hello!

My name is Rafa≈Ç Kornel, and I am a software developer.
This is my personal website. I will post my thoughts on technology, interesting findings, and sometimes
learning resources. I think writing down your knowledge is a key to striving in future AI landscape.

I'm currently working as a frontend developer, and I'm studying computer science.

I'm interested in all kinds of topics, starting from web development (frontend, backend, deployment), through game dev, AI and to security.
